By using 4 different classification algorithms, the following accuracy is obtained:
                 model  best_score                    best_params  
0        random_forest    0.903235           {'n_estimators': 50}   
1                  KNN    0.897221             {'n_neighbors': 7}   
2                  svm    0.853471  {'C': 20, 'kernel': 'linear'}   
3  logistic_regression    0.852384                     {'C': 100}
